# Vibe Coding & AI Tools

## What is Vibe Coding?
> "There's a new kind of coding I call 'vibe coding', where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists."
> — **Andrej Karpathy** (February 2025)

Vibe Coding represents a new paradigm in software development where the focus shifts from writing syntax to defining outcomes.
*   **You describe WHAT** you want in plain English.
*   **AI figures out HOW** to build it.
*   **You iterate** through conversation, not code.
*   **Anyone can build software**—no coding required.

## Today's Tools

### 1. Lovable (lovable.dev)
*   **Best For:** Building new web applications from scratch.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Text-to-app generation.
    *   Real-time, visual feedback.
    *   No coding knowledge needed.

### 2. Jules (jules.google)
*   **Best For:** Fixing, maintaining, and improving existing code.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Asynchronous "AI Agent" that works in the background.
    *   Connects directly to GitHub repositories.
    *   Handles tasks like writing unit tests, updating dependencies, and fixing bugs.

## Principles of Effective Prompting
To get the best results from these tools, follow these 4 principles:

1.  **Be Specific About Outcomes:** Avoid vague wishes (e.g., "Make a website"). Instead, describe the content, layout, and functionality in detail.
2.  **Describe the User:** Explain *who* the app is for (e.g., "community college biology students") to help the AI tailor the UX.
3.  **Specify Look and Feel:** Define the aesthetic (e.g., "modern design," "dark mode," "school colors").
4.  **Iterate in Small Steps:** Don't ask for everything at once. Build a foundation, then add features one by one (e.g., "Add a shuffle button," then "Add a score tracker").
